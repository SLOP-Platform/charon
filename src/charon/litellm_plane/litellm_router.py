"""Build a ``litellm.Router`` from the gateway's existing config — the ADR-0017 adopt.

``litellm.Router`` (imported as a LIBRARY, never its proxy-server/FastAPI/Prisma stack)
provides the commodity plane Charon hand-rolls: provider failover, cooldown/``allowed_fails``,
retry, mechanical ordering and a cost callback. This module maps Charon's live routing config
onto a ``Router`` while PRESERVING the money-path's security + policy controls at build time.

The ``litellm_plane`` outbound path is a NEW way for the product to reach providers, so it
MUST enforce the SAME egress controls the live money-path enforces at
``routing_policy.route_from_spec`` — otherwise it would be a bypass of the allowlist. It does:

  1. **base-bound provider key** (`secrets.get_provider_key`, #181) — each route's key is
     resolved bound to ``route.upstream_base`` and attached ONLY to that route's own
     ``api_base``; a route whose base was moved resolves NO key. litellm sends ``api_key`` to
     ``api_base`` 1:1, so the binding survives.
  2. **SSRF / non-routable refusal** (`netutil.validate_base_url`) — link-local / cloud-metadata
     / non-http bases raise before entering the ``model_list``.
  3. **preset-derived egress allowlist** (`egress.assert_base_allowed`, fail-CLOSED) — the
     EFFECTIVE base (the exact value written into the nested ``litellm_params['api_base']``,
     which is what litellm actually dials — the LiteLLM CVE-2024-6587 lesson) must be a
     git-tracked preset external host or a local host, else the route is REFUSED. A preset
     repointed off-preset or an attacker base is dropped exactly as the live path drops it.
  4. **no-redirect** — ``httpx`` (litellm's transport) does not follow redirects by default;
     :func:`no_redirect_client` pins ``follow_redirects=False`` for explicit wiring.
  5. **SG-never-Anthropic** (`providers.is_anthropic_route`) — any Anthropic
     model/provider/base is dropped from the ``model_list`` and can never be selected.
  6. **drain-then-park + funding-class order** — preserved as a PRE-ordering of each chain
     (`routing_policy.order_chain_by_funding_class` + parked exclusion) before assembly.

``litellm`` is imported lazily (inside :func:`make_router` / :func:`no_redirect_client`) so
this module imports cleanly with or without litellm installed — the pure-Python builder and
its security screening (controls 1, 2, 3, 5, 6) run and are testable regardless.
