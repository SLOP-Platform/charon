"""The ``AgentLaunch`` renderer seam (ADR-0014 D3/D4).

The work-engine routes a *tier* by asking the gateway to resolve a **tier vid**
to a provider chain (ADR-0014 D1). To stay product-neutral it must launch the
ACP agent without naming any specific agent product: it hands this seam an
``(acp_cmd, proxy_url, requested_model)`` and gets back an ``AgentLaunch`` — the
rendered launch contract (argv + passthrough env + the model id the agent will
request on the wire). The opencode-specific launch-config shape lives *behind*
the seam in ``OpencodeRenderer``; the engine never names opencode itself.

Exactly ONE renderer ships (opencode, ADR-0014 D3/B1). A generic/``claude-code``
renderer is NOT written on spec — additional renderers are gated on a live
``charon doctor`` probe (ADR-0014 Risks) and are out of scope here.

D4 invariant: a renderer's passthrough env NEVER carries a real provider key.
Behind the per-run proxy the gateway holds the key and injects it upstream; the
agent must not see it. ``_acp_passthrough_env(include_keys=False)`` is forced by
every renderer so a future renderer cannot regress that.

Gateway credential (WORK-GATEWAY-WIRE): the per-run proxy the agent is pointed at
is token-gated, so the agent must present that ONE gateway token (NOT a provider
key) to authenticate — else every LLM call 401s and the autonomous run dies at
dispatch. The renderer threads the proxy's own ``proxy_token`` straight into the
SAME injected launch config that overrides the baseURL, so baseURL + credential
travel together and the secret stays out of the broad process env (no fence hole:
the strict ``scrubbed_env`` whitelist is untouched). This is distinct from the D4
provider key — it is the local proxy's bearer, which the proxy itself minted.

Privileged-core / stdlib-only (ADR-0005 R3, ADR-0007 D11): this seam adds no
dependency — it only reshapes how the existing launch env is produced.
